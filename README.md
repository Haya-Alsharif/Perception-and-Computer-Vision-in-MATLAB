# Perception-and-Computer-Vision-in-MATLAB
This repository includes codes created for a graduate level Perception course at the University of Maryland. The repo includes codes for AR tag detection, colored underwater buoy detection, lane detection, car detection , traffic sign recognition and visual odometry for a moving car

## Underwater buoy detection
   
The three colored buoys were found and tracked through a video using 1-D Gaussian , 3-D Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Modeling for comparative studies

## AR Tag Detection

The output detects an AR Tag , identifies the tag based on the tag encoding and calculates the camera poses to superimpose a cube on the tag

## Car Tracking

Identifies the cars on a busy highway by providing positive and negative data to a KLT tracker

## Lane Detection

Identifies the currently occupied lane using Hough lines and detects the variations in slope to judge the curve of the road

## Traffic Sign Detection

Analyzes all signs on a drive through a crowded street and recognizes the signs in its database using MSER and SVM classification of HOG features detected

## Visual Odometry

Calculates the path travelled by a car using input from a video and outputs the localized trajectory using RANSAC . The output has comparative studies between different types of RANSAC functions
